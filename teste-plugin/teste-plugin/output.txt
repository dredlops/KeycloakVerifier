{{9.1}{Keycloak: path traversal via double URL encoding. A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it does not properly validate URLs included in a redirect. An attacker can use this flaw to construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and potentially sensitive information within the domain or possibly conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field.}{Remove wildcard from redirect URI's or update version to 20.0.2}{01/13/2023}}
{{2.7}{A logged in user can do an account email enumeration attack.}{Disable clients account-console/account or upgrade version}{02/11/2021}}

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.}{Update version}{08/23/2022}}
{{6.1}{The clients-registrations endpoint allows execution of javascript code on the client-side, which makes it vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting attack.}{Update version, put in place a reverse proxy to forbid any call to clients-registrations or configure Keycloak with ACL to limit access to clients-registrations}{03/25/2022}}
{{8.8}{A flaw was found in Keycloak in versions from 12.0.0 and before 15.1.1 which allows an attacker with any existing user account to create new default user accounts via the administrative REST API even when new user registration is disabled.}{Update version, or add an expression rejecting REST requests from other domains}{01/25/2022}}

{{5.4}{This flaw allows a privileged attacker to use the malicious payload as the group name while creating a new group from the admin console, leading to a stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.}{Update version}{08/26/2022}}
{{3.3}{A vulnerability was found in keycloak in the way that the OIDC logout endpoint does not have CSRF protection.}{Update version}{02/11/2021}}
{{3.8}{A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it did not properly check client tokens for possible revocation in its client credential flow. This flaw allows an attacker to access or modify potentially sensitive information.}{Update version}{01/13/2023}}
{{3.8}{A Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in keycloak as shipped in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7. This flaw allows a privileged attacker to execute malicious scripts in the admin console, abusing the default roles functionality.}{Update version}{09/01/2022}}
{{6.1}{A flaw was found in the Keycloak Node.js Adapter. This flaw allows an attacker to benefit from an Open Redirect vulnerability in the checkSso function.}{Update version}{03/27/2023}}
